# info_card
Flutter application contains admin information.

- This application only works on web and Android devices.

- The main icon is the same as Flutter's default (I will change it as soon as possible).

- This application is only a test, and it will improve in the future.

- There is a slight problem with the url_launcher package, and currently it's not working, but I will try to fix that so I won't delete the codes.

- Here is a preview of the application.
